## Overview
 
Film-Space is a RESTful full-stack film review app allowing users to add films and make reviews of them. Users will be able to give their ratings and opinions about films to help other users.
 
## Technologies
 
### BackEnd
 
- Django Rest Framework
- JWT Auth
- Python
- Postgres
 
### FrontEnd
 
- React.js
- Bulma
- npm
- React-star-ratings
 
## Process
 
Before starting to code, I did a sketch using Figma to have an idea of how the app should look.

The starting point was to create a database using Django and Python. First, I made a diagram of the database to visualize the structure and the relations between the models.

After, using the diagram as an example I started to build my backend using Django Rest Framework with python. I made the models of the films, reviews, users and genres.
 
After I made the relations between the models to build the database. Then I created some films, users, and reviews to check if I received correctly the data.
 
Starting with the FrontEnd I made login and register user pages to create users. Then I built an index page to receive all the films that I have in my database.

Then I made a form page to add a film to the database if you are a registered user.

Finally, I created an info page for all the films, which have data of the film (name, author, release date, and genres) and users can post their ratings with comments. I used a third-party library (react-star-rating) to create a rating system. Also, all users/visitors can see the comments.

## Wins
My biggest win in this project was to create the star rating systems in the FrontEnd and send the data to the BackEnd. I took my time to understand how to use react-star-rating. Iâ€™m so proud of the results.
 
 
```
const StarRating = ( { handleChange, rating } ) => {
 // console.log(rating)
 return (
   <div>
     {[ ...stars].map((star, i) => {
       return (
         <label>
           <input
             type="radio"
             name="rating"
             value={i + 1}
             onClick={handleChange}
           />
           <FaStar
           className="star"
           size={20}
           color={i + 1 <= rating ? "#ffc107" : "#e4e5e9" }
           />
         </label>
       )
     })}
   </div>
 )
}
 
export default StarRating
 
```
 
## Challenges
 
This was the fourth project for the course. In this last project, I had to create a full-stack app myself using another programming language (Python) with Django for the BackEnd. First, my first problem was to create a database structure, that focused on the relations between users/films, reviews/films, and finally genres/films. Secondly, I experienced problems linking the BackEnd (Python) with the FrontEnd (React.js), I solved this problem by renaming the data in the frontend.
Finally, it was tricky to make a rating system for the films, I used react-star-rating and created a function to give each star a value to rate the film.
 
## Learnings
 
This was a small scale project to learn the process of Django and PostgreSQL, I learned some of the basic of Django, how to make relationships (1:M, M:M), how serializers work and how to link two different languages in different parts of my app FrontEnd (React.js), BackEnd (Django, Python).
